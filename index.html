            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              Mann Co., stylized as MANN CO., is a multinational division of TF Industries with headquarters in the Badlands, near Teufort, 
              New Mexico. In the Badlands area alone, the company operates over 300 plants, office buildings, warehouses and outlet malls.
              The company was originally incorporated in the United States as Mann & Sons Munitions Concern by the arms-dealer Zepheniah Mann, 
              who co-managed the firm with his brother, Silas Mann. Upon his death in 1850, Zepheniah Mann bequeathed ownership of Mann Co. 
              to close friend and hunter Barnabus Hale. The company was subsequently owned and operated by three generations of Hales.
